# Getting-data-assignment-w4

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science is wearable computing. Companies have made new and sophisticated algorithms to attract more users.

The course has provided a dataset of accelerometer data from a Samsung galaxy smartphone in a zip file.

The purpose of the assignment is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with and lean the data set.

The available data in X and Y variables measure the waist-mounted smartphone and activity types respectively.

The project has a run_Analysis.R file that does the following :
1} merges training test sets to create one data set
2}Extracts only measurements on mean and standard deviations for each measurement
3}Uses descriptive activity names to name activities in data set
4}Appropriately labels data set with descriptive variable names
5} Creates a second independent tidy data set with average of each variable for each activity and each subject

Here is the data for the project:
